    <p>Hobbies are a great way to relax and unwind. These are done after a stressful day at school, college, or office.
        There is no rule of what can be termed as a hobby. It could be anything, from stamp collection to painting, or
        even travelling. Anything can be considered as a hobby if it relaxes your mind.</p>
